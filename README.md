# MorseCodeCracker
This program implements Binary Search Trees (BST) using Python. The data uses morse code representation and can be found in morse.py. This file also has functions that store letters and matching Morse codes, compare elements by letter attribute, compare elements by code attribute, fill a BST with Morse code by the letter element using the letter/code pairs, fill a BST with Morse code by the code element using the letter/code pairs, encode text and convert it from English text to Morse code by extracting the equivalent morse code value to the text stored in a BST, and lastly, the program decodes code and converts it from Morse code to English by extracting the English letter equivalent to the Morse code value stored in a BST. The files t01.py to t06.py execute different tasks that test the functionalities of morse.py. The result of all these tests can be found in the file testing.txt.
